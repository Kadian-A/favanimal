<p> I always thought crows where an intresting bird, they aren't really liked by many people and concidered a bad omen in some culters. I remeber seeing them in the morning on my way to school and hearing them caw always brought a sense of calm to me. They are amoung the most intellignet speices of birds in the world, they have been known to use tools ot help get food such as sticks rocks and even cars! They are also in almost every region of the U.S, and to add a cherry on top crows and owls will fight each other to the death on sight as owls are known to eat corvid young. </p>
<p> A crow is a bird of the genus Corvus, or more broadly, a synonym for all of Corvus. The word "crow" is used as part of the common name of many species. The related term "raven" is not linked scientifically to any certain trait but is rather a general grouping for larger-sized species of Corvus. The collective name for a group of crows is a "murder".[1]
